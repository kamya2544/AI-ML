Introduction to Machine Learning:
-The idea of learning from examples and experience w/o being explicitly programmed.
-Instead of writing code, we feed data to a generic algorithm, and it builds logic based on the data given.

Three types of ML:
-Supervised Learning (i/p and o/p data available)
-Unsupervised Learning (only i/p data available)
-Reinforcement Learning (expose the model to the real system and it will learn itself based on renewal or penalty)

Supervised learning:
-Dependent variable (y) and independent variable (x)
-Learns from previous data
-Two Subtypes:
	-Classification: o/p is a group or category eg-black or white, spam or not spam
	-Regression: o/p is a real value eg- rupees, height

Unsupervised Learning:
-Only i/p data is available
-System finds patterns directly from examples
-Two Subtypes:
	-Association: discover rules that describe large positions of data eg- people who buy apples tend to buy mango, on Amazon there is a "people also bought" and "often bought together" column 
	-Clustering: discover inherent clusters in data eg- kids usually purchase chocolates, boys usually purchase batteries, girls usually purchase stationery

Reinforcement Learning:
-Comp prog interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a particular goal
-Depending on the task we change, the reward and penalty are decided

Applications:
-Face Detection
-Email Filtering
-Medical Diagnosis
-Weather Prediction
