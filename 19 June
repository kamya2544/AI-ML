Introduction to Machine Learning:
-The idea of learning from examples and experience w/o being explicitly programmed.
-Instead of writing code, we feed data to a generic algorithm, and it builds logic based on the data given.

Three types of ML:
-Supervised Learning (i/p and o/p data available)
-Unsupervised Learning (only i/p data available)
-Reinforcement Learning (expose the model to the real system and it will learn itself based on renewal or penalty)

Supervised learning:
-Dependent variable (y) and independent variable (x)
-Learns from previous data
-Two Subtypes:
	-Classification: o/p is a group or category eg-black or white, spam or not spam
	-Regression: o/p is a real value eg- rupees, height
